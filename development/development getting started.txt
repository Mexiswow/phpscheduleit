Getting the development branch running

1) Create and populate the database
	run schema.sql
	run data.sql
	run testdata.sql (optional)
	
2) Set configuration values
	update newconfig.php with your local settings

Design philosphies
	[page].php should 
		1) define ROOT_DIR
		2) include /Pages/[page]Page.php
		3) construct [page]Page and call PageLoad()
	
	Each page should have at least one corressponding template in /tpl
	Each page should have a corresponding class in /Pages
	Each Page class should have a corresponding presenter class in /Presenters
	
	All classes should have good unit test coverage (level of coverage is up to the developer)
