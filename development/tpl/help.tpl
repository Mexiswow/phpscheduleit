<div id="help">
    <h2>Registration</h2>

    <p>
        Registration is required in order to use phpScheduleIt if you administrator has enabled it. After your account
        has been registered
        you will be able to log in and access any resources that you have permission to.
    </p>

    <h2>Booking</h2>

    <p>
        Under the Schedule menu item you will find the Booking item. This will show you the available, reserved and
        blocked slots on the schedule and allow you to book
        resources that you have permission to.
    </p>

    <h3>Express</h3>

    <p>
        On the Bookings page, find the resource, date and time you'd like to book. Clicking on the time slot will allow
        you change the details of the reservation. Clicking the
        Create button will check availability, book the reservation and send out any emails. You will be given a
        reference number to use for reservation follow-up.
    </p>

    <p>Any changes made to a reservation will not take effect until you save the reservation.</p>

    <h3>Multiple Resources</h3>

    <p>You can book all resources that you have permission as part of a single reservation. To add more resources to
        your reservation, click the More Resources link, displayed next to the name of the primary resource you are
        reserving. You will then able to add more resources by selecting them and clicking the Done button.</p>

    <p>To remove additional resources from your reservation, click the More Resources link, deselect the resources you
        want to remove, and click the Done button.</p>

    <p>Additional resources will be subject to the same rules as primary resources. For example, this means that if you
        attempt to create a 2 hour reservation with Resource 1, which has a maximum length of 3 hours and with Resource
        2, which
        has a maximum length of 1 hour, your reservation will be denied.</p>

    <p>You can view the configuration details of a resource by hovering over the resource name.</p>

    <h3>Recurring Dates</h3>

    <p></p>

    <h3>Additional Participants</h3>

    <p>You can either Add Participants or Invite Others when booking a reservation. Adding someone will include them on
        the reservation and will not send an invitation.
        The added user will receive an email. Inviting a user will send an invitation email and give the user an option
        to Accept or Decline the invitation. Accepting an
        invitation adds the user to the participants list. Declining an invitation removes the user from the invitees
        list.
    </p>

    <p>
        The total number of participants is limited by the resource's participant capacity.
    </p>

    <h3>Accessories</h3>

    <p>Accessories can be thought of as objects used during a reservation. Examples may be projectors or chairs. To add
        accessories to your reservation, click the Add link to the right of the Accessories title. From there you will
        be able to select a quantity for each of the available accessories. The quantity available during your
        reservation time will depend on how many accessories are already reserved.</p>

    <h3>Booking on behalf of others</h3>

    <p>Application Administrators and Group Administrators can book reservations on behalf of other users by clicking
        the Change link to the right of the user's name.</p>

    <p>Application Administrators and Group Administrators can also modify and delete reservations owned by other
        users.</p>
