        <h1>Welcome to phpScheduleIt 2.0! (A quick installation).</h1>

        <!--**section**-->

        <h2 style="font-style:italic; color:red;">This is a pre-release version of phpScheduleIt. It will certainly contain bugs
            and is not yet suitable for production use.</h2>

        <!--**section**-->

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>PHP 5.2 or greater.</li>
            <li>MySQL 5.0 or greater.</li>
            <li>Web server (e.g Apache2, etc...).</li>
            <li>OS - Windows, Mac, Unix-like were tested.</li>
        </ul>
        <p STYLE="color:red">
            Note: for users without web host service. If you want to accomplish all of the above quick and easy? 
            try this apachefriends.org, it will do it for you in no time. <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html">XAMMP</a> 
            <span STYLE="color:red">(highly recommended).</span>
        </p>

        <!--**section**-->

        <h2>Server Deployment</h2>

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Untar or unzip the distribution in your webserver's document root.</li>
                <li>If you don't have direct access to your document root and use hosting service, 
                    put the files in a directory on your local machine, 
                    and transfer the directory on your web server using, for example, ftp or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/winscp/">WinSCP</a>.</li>
                <li>Note: Some may have directory permission issues. Contact support below or contact your hosting service to resolve.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--**section**-->

        <h2>Application Configuration</h2>

        <div>
            You can configure phpScheduleIt to fit your environments and needs or use the minimal default settings which is enough for the application to work.
            <ul>
                <li>In addition, to allow resource image uploads, the web-server account requires read/write 
                    access to your configured uploads directory ($conf['settings']['image.upload.directory']).</li>
                <li>To customize, you can open /config/config.php and alter the settings to your environment.</li>
            </ul>
            Note: If you try to load the application at this time (eg. http://yourhostname/phpScheduleIt/Web/), you will probably get a white page. 
            Because there is no backend database configured yet.
        </div>

        <!--**section**-->

        <h2>Database Setup</h2>
        You have 2 ways to set up your database for the application to work.

        <h3>1) Automated</h3>

        <div>The packaged database scripts make assumptions about your desired database configuration and set default values. 
            Please edit them to suit your environment before running located phpScheduleIt/database_schema/.</div>

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The web server must have write access to /your-phpScheduleIt/tpl_c and /your-phpScheduleIt/tpl 
                    <a href="http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/variable.compile.dir.tpl">(why?)</a></li>
                <li>The automated database setup only supports MySQL at this time. To run the automated database setup, navigate to the
                    /Web/install directory in a web browser and follow the on screen instructions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--**section**--> OR<br/>

        <h3>2) Manual</h3>

        <div>
            The packaged database scripts make assumptions about your desired database configuration and set default values. 
            Please edit them to suit your environment before running located phpScheduleIt/database_schema/. 
            Import the following sql files in the listed order (recommending <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/documentation/">phpmyadmin interface</a>):
        </div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The web server must have write access to /your-phpScheduleIt/tpl_c and /your-phpScheduleIt/tpl 
                    <a href="http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/variable.compile.dir.tpl">(why?)</a></li>
                <li>import "/database_schema/create-db.sql" to mysql db (phpscheduleit2 db created)</li>
                <li>import "/database_schema/schema-utf8.sql" to phpscheduleit2 (db schema created)</li>
                <li>import "/database_schema/create-user.sql" to mysql db (schedule_user/password mysql account created to match to your default configuration
                    and notice: this is not the application user!). At this point with the aforementioned default configuration in your-phpScheduleIt/config/config.php 
                    your application can connect to the database and loaded eg. see http://localhost/your-phpScheduleIt/Web/index.php 
                    but you can not login since there is no application data or user, so go to next step
                </li>
                <li>import "/database_schema/data-utf8.sql" to phpscheduleit2 (initializing application database)</li>
                <li>import "/database_schema/testdata-utf8.sql" to phpscheduleit2 (a sample application data created with 2 users:
                    1) admin/password and 2) nkorbel/password). Use these users for testing your installation. <span STYLE="color:red">You are done. Congratulation!</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--**section**-->

        <h4>The First Login</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Aforementioned if you imported a sample application data, you now can use 1) admin/password and 2) nkorbel/password to login and make changes from the application.</li>
            <li>Or you will need to register an account with your configured admin email address. This is specified in the following
                config.php setting: $conf['settings']['admin.email']<br/>
                For the email registration process to work - this means it will send you an email with account login information.
                You need to make sure your email server is working and the application is configured. Look for smtp.* parameters,
                and fill them in properly. Examples are shown next the parameters.</li>
        </ul>

        <!--**section**-->

        <h4>Log Files</h4>
        phpScheduleIt logs multiple levels of information categorized into either application or database logs. To do this, the log4php library is used.
        By default, logging is turned OFF.
        <ul>
            <li>First, rename /config/log4php.config.dist.xml to /config/log4php.config.xml</li>
            <li>To allow application logging, the PHP account requires read/write access to your configured log directory
            <li>Logging is configured in /config/log4php.config.xml</li>
            <li>Logging is controlled by changing the &lt;level&gt; of each &lt;logger&gt;</li>
            <li>Levels used by phpScheduleIt are OFF, DEBUG, ERROR.  For normal operation, ERROR is appropriate.  If trace logs are needed, DEBUG is appropriate.</li>
            <li>To turn on application logging, change the &lt;level value=&quot;OFF&quot; /&gt; to an appropriate level for either the default or sql loggers.  
                For example, &lt;level value=&quot;ERROR&quot; /&gt;</li>
            <li>For more information on logging configuration, visit <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4php/">Log4Php</a></li>
        </ul>
